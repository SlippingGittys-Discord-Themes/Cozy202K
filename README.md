## Extra info ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Though this is a fork of [Comfy](https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-theme), this theme has little to nothing in common with it. I am simply just too lazy to detach it from it's parent. The idea behind this theme stems from another theme concept by Tamago-iku, which you can see [here](https://github.com/Tamago-iku/Discord-202K-theme). The rest of the additions are just to fully realize LeoCharte's concept art.
