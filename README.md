# Comfy202K

**THIS IS A FORK OF THE [COMFY THEME](https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-theme) AND [DISCORD-202K](https://github.com/Tamago-iku/Discord-202K-theme). THE CHANGES ARE MINIMAL AND MERELY MERGE EACH OTHER'S COLORS PLUS SOME OTHER TINY ADDITIONS. PLEASE CHECK CHECK OUT COMFY-DISCORD AND DISCORD-202K ON THEIR MAIN REPOS.**

Compliance with the GLPv3 license requires that I give a tutorial on how to install. While the theme isn't finished, I will comply merely so as to not break it's copyleft: 

* Powercord
`cd (powercord-dir)/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/SlippingGitty/Comfy-Discord-202k-Theme`
  * `(powercord dir)` is frequently C:/Users/USERNAME/powercord
